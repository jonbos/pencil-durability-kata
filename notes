Some thoughts after finishing the degradation logic:
	1. I don't like the way I had to immediately begin integration testing. Maybe I'll have another run at this when I'm finished..I'd like to be able to do more isolated tests of the pencil object.

	2. I'd like to resolve the default durability. Either the pencil should have unlimited durability unless designed otherwise, or I'll do some calculating to try and find a good default. http://towriteamockingbird.blogspot.com <- this will help

As I build each function, I'm starting by testing that I can instantiate a pencil with the property that will guide the functionality (length, durability, eraser durability). Maybe those tests should be housed in a separate test class eg PencilCreationTests.
